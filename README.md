# code_quiz
This application will be a scored quiz.
Once the quiz starts, the time will start.
When a question is answered correctly, another question will be presented.
If a question answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
Once all questions are answered or the time reaches 0, the game is over.
When the game is over, you can save your score and log your initials.
